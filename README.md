# Machine-Learning-Scripts

## 📝 Description
During my Master's program in Machine Learning, I developed several scripts that demonstrate my understanding of fundamental concepts and practical implementation of various machine learning algorithms. These scripts showcase my ability to preprocess data, build models, evaluate their performance, and make predictions on unseen data.

## 📚 Dataset
The datasets vary according to the type of algorithm to be applied to each of the scripts
